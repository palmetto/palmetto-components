# ResponsiveProvider

Use a `ResponsiveProvider` to provide window size context to all children components. This circumvents the need
to set up individual resize listeners per component when detailed responsive behavior is required.

This component is meant to be used in conjunction with the `useWindowSize` and `useBreakpoint` hooks provided in order to write responsive
markup without diving into CSS.

## Basic Usage

The `ResponsiveProvider` component can wrap any JSX component but in order to leverage the performance gains of a single context,
it is best to use it once in an application, and placed as high as possible in the component tree (likely wrapping the App itself).

The example below shows basic usage.

Our library includes opinionated [breakpoints](/?path=/docs/design-tokens-breakpoints--page). The `useBreakpoint` hook exposes
these to any component nested under a `ResponsiveProvider`

```js codesandbox=palmetto-components
import React from 'react';
import { ResponsiveProvider, useBreakpoint, Box } from '@palmetto/palmetto-components';

export default () => {
  const ConsumerApp = () => {
    const { isPhone, isTablet, isDesktop, isHd } = useBreakpoint();

    return (
      <Box childGap="md">
        <p>phone: {isPhone ? '✅' : '❌'}</p>
        <p>tablet: {isTablet ? '✅' : '❌'}</p>
        <p>desktop: {isDesktop ? '✅' : '❌'}</p>
        <p>hd: {isHd ? '✅' : '❌'}</p>
      </Box>
    );
  };
 
  return (
    <ResponsiveProvider>
      <ConsumerApp />
    </ResponsiveProvider>
  );
};
```
