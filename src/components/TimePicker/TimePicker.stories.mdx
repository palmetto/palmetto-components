# TimePicker

Use a TimePicker when you want users to select from a list of a available times agnostic of date.

*NOTE:* This component is abstracted from the [SelectInput](?path=/docs/components-form-inputs-selectinput--default-story)
and as such includes the same underlying props interface with an added method for generating the time options automatically.

*ABOUT TIME FORMAT:* While the `value` prop technicall returns `{ label: string; value: string; }` the value returned will always
be a JS ISO date string, like this: `2016-07-13T18:46:01.933Z`.

## Props

<ArgsTable of={TimePicker} />

## Default

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Default">
    {() => {
      const [value, setValue] = useState(null);
      return (
        <Box height="360px">
          <TimePicker
            id="myTimePicker"
            name="TimePickerName"
            onChange={event => { setValue(event.target.value) }}
            label="Pick a Time"
            value={value}
          />
        </Box>
      );
    }}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## With A Specific Interval

Pass an `interval` (seconds) value to determine how many times get generated as options.
The example below uses `3600` --> 1 Hour Intervals

<Canvas>
  <Story name="With Interval">
    {() => {
      return (
        <Box height="360px">
          <TimePicker
            id="myTimePicker"
            name="TimePickerName"
            onChange={() => {}}
            label="Pick a Time"
            interval={3600}
          />
        </Box>
      );
    }}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## With Min and Max Times

You can determine the range of times to be shown by capping the start and end times.
Use `startTime` and `endTime` for this. The expected values for `hour` and `minute` properties 
are `0-24` and `0-60` respectively.

IMPORTANT: `startTime` is inclusive, and `endTime` is exclusive. This is to avoid
the options showing the startTime twice when using a 24-hour cycle.

See example below where we want to show 15 minute increments starting at 9:00AM and ending at 3:30PM.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="With Start and End">
    {() => {
      return (
        <Box height="360px">
          <TimePicker
            id="myTimePicker"
            name="TimePickerName"
            onChange={() => {}}
            label="Pick a Time"
            startTime={{ hour: 9, minute: 0 }}
            endTime={{ hour: 15, minute: 31 }}
          />
        </Box>
      );
    }}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## With Custom Date Display

The labels for the dropdwon options are governed by JS `toLocaleTimeString`, and as such
options are available to customize these.

NOTE: that the option values are always returned as ISO strings regardless of the label display option.

The example below is shown in military (24-hour) time.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="With Custom Date">
    {() => {
      return (
        <Box height="360px">
          <TimePicker
            id="myTimePicker"
            name="TimePickerName"
            onChange={() => {}}
            label="Pick a Time"
            startTime={{ hour: 9, minute: 0 }}
            endTime={{ hour: 15, minute: 31 }}
            dateDisplayOptions={{ hour12: false, hour: '2-digit', minute: '2-digit' }}
          />
        </Box>
      );
    }}
  </Story>
</Canvas>
