# FormLabel

FormLabel is a sub component of many of our inputs, and is meant to be paired with a form input. In most cases, the label will have already been built into another component as a prop. However, you can use it on its own or with another component.

<Canvas isExpanded>
  <FormLabel>Form Label</FormLabel>
</Canvas>


## Props

<ArgsTable of={FormLabel} />

## Accessibility

- Each label requires the `inputId` prop that equals the id of the associated input so that the `htmlFor` property can be set.
- Don't use placeholder text as a replacement for labels. It can be used to provide an example to users, but will disappear from the field when a user enters text. It's also not broadly supported by assistive technologies and won't display in older browsers.
- Use one of 3 ways to label a form field in order of most preferred:
  1. Visible label with Label
  2. Visible label that's associated to the input with aria-labelledby
  3. Label directly using aria-label

## Examples

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Default">
    <FormLabel>Default label</FormLabel>
  </Story>
</Canvas>

### Help Text

Use `helpText` to add additional context for the FormLabel's input.
This can help keep checkbox label concise.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Help Text">
    <FormLabel inputId="required" helpText="More helpful text about the input">
      Required input label
    </FormLabel>
  </Story>
</Canvas>

### Required

A label for an input that is required is marked with an asterisk.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Required">
    <FormLabel inputId="required" isFieldRequired>
      Required input label
    </FormLabel>
  </Story>
</Canvas>

### Interactive Label

FormLabels support the ability to for its text to be interactive or link to another page.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="More than just text">
    <>
      <FormLabel inputId="customText">
        This label has a span with
        <span style={{ fontStyle: 'italic' }}>&nbsp;Italic&nbsp;</span>
        and also a&nbsp;
        <a href="https://palmetto.com" target="_blank">
          Link
        </a>
      </FormLabel>
    </>
  </Story>
</Canvas>
