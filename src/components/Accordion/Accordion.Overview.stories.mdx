# Accordion

The accordion component delivers a large amount of information in a small amount of space through progress disclosure. It is ideally used to shorten pages or reduce scrolling when it is not critical that content be fully read.

Accordions are useful when you want to toggle between hiding and showing additional content for related information, such as a Glossary or FAQ.

              <p>
                Solar panels, also called photovoltaic or PV panels, consist of solar cells that are
                designed to capture the radiant light and heat contained in sunlight and convert it
                into usable clean energy for your home.
              </p>
              <p>
                When sunlight hits your solar panel, the photons of energy are converted into DC
                (direct current) electricity, which is then converted into AC (alternating current)
                electricity for use in your home. Solar panels are often grouped together to form a
                solar grid or solar array, allowing you to capture and harness the right amount of
                energy for your needs.

              How do I know if solar is right for me?

            <Accordion.PanelDetails>
              <p>
                There are several factors we can look at to determine if solar might be a good
                solution for your needs, including roof space, home energy usage, credit health, and
                eligibility for incentives. At Palmetto, we start by calculating a quick savings
                estimate based on your home, location, and current utility costs. Then, we’ll
                schedule a meeting to clarify your goals, address any questions, identify purchase
                options, and outline the solar process. All of this happens before you pay, allowing
                you to decide if a solar power system is right for you based on a complete
                understanding of the potential costs and savings.

            <Accordion.PanelDetails>
              <p>
                The right solar power system for your home will depend on a variety of factors,
                including your current energy usage, the size and layout of your roof, and your
                preferred level of energy independence. To hone in on the right solution for your
                home, we always begin with a personal consultation and a survey, both of which serve
                to clarify your goals and outline available options. Should you choose to invest,
                we’ll design a custom solution to meet your goals and maximize your savings—no
                haggling, no upselling, just right.

## Caret Options

By default the caret is on the right. You can render the caret on the left side so the accordion has a folder structure like appearance using the `hasCaret` prop on the `Accordion.PanelSummary` component.

### No Caret

You can also choose to hide the caret altogether. Moreover, the accordion is a very transparent custom implementation of the `<Details>` component so if more custom behavior is required, you can build your own custom accordions `<Details>` details as well.
