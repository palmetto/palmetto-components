# TextLink

Use links to direct a user to a new location. Can be use for in-app navigation via [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/)
or anchor tag based links.

## Props

When the `href` is set, the `TextLink` accepts all valid [HTML anchor element attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a), such as `_target`.

When `to` is set, the `TextLink` accepts all [React Router Link](https://reactrouter.com/web/api/Link) props.

<ArgsTable of={TextLink} />

## Default

All that is required to render a basic version of a TextLink is `children` which will contain text
or a ReactNode to be rendered as well as an `href` attribute. `TextLink` will render an anchor tag automatically
when given an `href`, and you can use the same exact API as a traditional anchor, as seen here:
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Default">
    {() => {
      return (
        <TextLink href="http://palmetto.com">Click me!</TextLink>
      );
    }}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## With React Router

If you're doing in-app navigation and need to render a [React Router Link](https://reactrouter.com/web/api/Link) component,
simply use React Router's `component` prop on the `Link` component. All Link props will be passed down to the anchor tag.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="With React Router" decorators={[Story => <BrowserRouter><Story /></BrowserRouter>]}>
    {() => {
      return (
        <Link to="/" component={TextLink}>Click me!</Link>
      );
    }}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## With Attributes & Other Props

Whether you're using React Router or just displaying an anchor tag, you can follow the native
APIs for each option

<Canvas>
  <Story name="With additional attributes">
    {() => {
      return (
        <TextLink href="http://ux.palmetto.com" target="_blank">
          I will open in a new tab
        </TextLink>
      );
    }}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

<Canvas>
  <Story name="With Link props" decorators={[Story => <BrowserRouter><Story /></BrowserRouter>]}>
    {() => {
      return (
        <Link to="/" replace component={TextLink}>I will replace the current history entry</Link>
      );
    }}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## In the middle of a paragraph

Text links are often used to highlight clickable text inside of a larger block of copy.
You can use our text link in this manner as well.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Inside a paragraph">
    {() => {
      return (
        <p>
          This is a longish paragraph. Even though it says nothing of value, it does contain
          a link so that's exciting! Can you find <TextLink href="https://ux.palmetto.com">the link</TextLink> that's in here?
        </p>
      );
    }}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

The font size is inherited by its parent.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="With inherited font-size">
    {() => {
      return (
        <p className="font-size-sm">
          The link component will inherit your container's font size so you can place it anywhere
          and it should fit in just fine.
          Here is <TextLink href="https://ux.palmetto.com">that link</TextLink> again but inheriting
          a small font-size.
        </p>
      );
    }}
  </Story>
</Canvas>


## Color Variations

Text link is available in the standard `primary` variant as well as `danger`. Pass the `variant` prop
to render en either of these.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Color variations">
    {() => {
      return (
        <p>
          We've got two variations if you want to communicate that a certain link may do something harmful,
          use the <TextLink href="https://ux.palmetto.com" variant="danger">danger</TextLink> style. Otherwise
          go with the default <TextLink href="https://ux.palmetto.com">primary</TextLink>.
        </p>
      );
    }}
  </Story>
</Canvas>
