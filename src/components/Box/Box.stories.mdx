# Box

A `<Box>` is a layout component to build UIs with consistent padding and spacing between elements.
It lays out it contents in a specified direction, and by default renders a `div` element.

    >
      I am a Box
    </Box>
    <Box
      margin="lg"
      padding="md"
      background="info-lighter"
