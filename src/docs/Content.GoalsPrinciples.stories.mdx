  These guidelines may be modified, expanded, or updated over time as new needs arise. It’s impossible to predict every possible content need, and there may be exceptions that are required to aid with legibility, branding, etc. If you have any questions about how to use this guide, or you have a content need that goes against one of these guidelines, please post that request in the <a href="https://palmetto-team.slack.com/archives/C01QE0AAT4Z">#Content Slack Channel</a> and it will be reviewed for consideration.

    <Box as="p" fontSize={{ base: 'md', tablet: 'lg'}} color="grey-500">In order to achieve our content goals, we follow these principles:</Box>
  </Box>

  <table className="w-100">
    <tr>
      <td className="font-weight-bold">Clear</td>
      <td>
        Understand the topic you’re writing about. Use simple words and sentences. Complexity and jargon are often used to mask a lack of true understanding. If you can’t explain it to a 5-year-old, you don’t really understand it.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td className="font-weight-bold">Useful</td>
      <td>
        Before you start writing, ask yourself: What purpose does this serve? Who is going to read it? What do they need to know?
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td className="font-weight-bold">Genuine</td>
      <td>
        We relate to customers’ challenges and passions and speak to them in a familiar, warm, and accessible way.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td className="font-weight-bold">Friendly</td>
      <td>
        Write like a human. Don’t be afraid to break a few rules if it makes your writing more relatable. All of our content, from splashy homepage copy to system alerts, should be warm and human.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td className="font-weight-bold">Inclusive</td>
      <td>
  Our sense of humor is straight-faced, subtle, and a touch eccentric. We’re smart but not snobbish, and never inappropriate. We prefer winking to shouting. We’re never condescending or exclusive—we always bring our customers in on the joke.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td className="font-weight-bold">Plainspoken</td>
      <td>
  We understand the world our customers are living in: one muddled by hyperbolic language, upsells, and over-promises. We strip all that away and value clarity above all. Because homeowners come to Palmetto to take control of their energy usage, we avoid distractions like fluffy metaphors and cheap plays to emotion.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td className="font-weight-bold">Appropriate</td>
      <td>
  Write in a way that suits the situation. Just like you do in face-to-face conversations, adapt your tone depending on who you’re writing to and what you’re writing about.
      </td>
    </tr>
