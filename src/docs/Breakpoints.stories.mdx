# Breakpoints

Palmetto components follow a "mobile-first" approach, where styles are set with mobile devices considered first. Then styling adjustments are made as each minimum viewport width &mdash; the breakpoint &mdash; is reached.

The following breakpoints are used in utility classes, but you can use them to modify your application depending on the user's viewport size.

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>token name</th>
      <th>value</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    {Object.entries(size.breakpoint).map(([name, entry], i) => (
      <tr key={i}>
        <td><code>{`size-breakpoint-${name}`}</code></td>
        <td>{entry.value}</td>
      </tr>
    ))}
    <tr>
      <td><code>size-breakpoint-base</code></td>
      <td>0px</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
