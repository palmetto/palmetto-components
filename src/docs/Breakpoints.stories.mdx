# Breakpoints

Palmetto components follow a "mobile-first" approach, where styles are set with mobile devices considered first. Then styling adjustments are made as each minimum viewport width &mdash; the breakpoint &mdash; is reached.

The following breakpoints are used in utility classes, but you can use them to modify your application depending on the user's viewport size.

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>name</th>
      <th>value</th>
      <th>notes</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    {PALMETTO_BREAKPOINT_OPTIONS.map((radius, i) => (
      <tr key={i}>
        <td><code>{`size-breakpoint-${radius}`}</code></td>
        <td>{PALMETTO_BREAKPOINT_VALUES[i].value}</td>
        <td>{PALMETTO_BREAKPOINT_VALUES[i].original.comment}</td>
      </tr>
    ))}
  </tbody>
</table>
