# Grammar and Mechanics

Certain rules of grammar and mechanics help keep our writing clear and consistent. This section will lay out our house style, which applies to all of our content unless otherwise noted in this guide. (We cover a lot of ground in this section‚Äîthe search feature will help if you're looking for something in particular.)

## Write For All Readers

Some people will read every word you write. Others will just skim. Help everyone read better by grouping related ideas together and using descriptive headers and subheaders.

- **Be Concise** - Use simple words and sentences. Avoid unnecessary modifiers.
- **Be Specific** - Avoid vague language. Cut the fluff.
- **Be Consistent** - Stick to the copy patterns and style points outlined in this guide.

Most importantly, Focus Your Message

- Create a hierarchy of information.
- Communicate one idea per paragraph.
- Lead with the main point or the most important content in sentences, paragraphs, sections, and pages.

Strive to create scannable content so readers can quickly access information they‚Äôre looking for.

- Headers should be descriptive and clear (not clever and vague)
- Use bulleted lists to identify key points or takeaways
- Use bold text to highlight key words

## Guidelines

### Abbreviations and Acronyms

Clean energy is filled with acronyms, but they can be confusing for people who don‚Äôt work in the industry. Spell out abbreviation and acronym the first time you use them, and specify the abbreviation in parenthesis. Then use the short version for all other references. (Note: For blog posts, it may be preferred to continue using both the acronym and long-form version of terms for SEO benefits.)

- First use: Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA)
- Second use: SEIA
- First use: Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)
- Second use: UTC

If the abbreviation or acronym is well known, like NASA or HTML, use it instead (and don‚Äôt worry about spelling it out).

### Active Voice

Use an active voice. Avoid a passive voice.

In an active voice, the subject of the sentence does the action. In a passive voice, the subject of the sentence has the action done to it.

- Active Voice (Good): Marti logged into the account.
- Passive Voice (Bad): The account was logged into by Marti.

Words like ‚Äúwas‚Äù and ‚Äúby‚Äù may indicate that you‚Äôre writing in a passive voice. Scan for these words and rework sentences where they appear.

If, however, you want to emphasize the action over the subject, passive voice may be preferred.

### Capitalization

We use a few different forms of capitalization. Title Case capitalizes the first letter of every word except articles, prepositions of four or fewer letters, and conjunctions, and should be used for all headlines, website section headers, titles, and buttons.

Sentence case capitalizes the first letter of the first word, and should be used for all in-app section headers and long-form writing.

Title Case Headlines Are Good
Only the first letter of a sentence should be capitalized when writing out longer content.

When complete sentences are used in headers, it‚Äôs ok to only capitalize the first word of that sentence, especially if the header is a question.

There are exceptions. For example, you can capitalize every word if it helps with legibility.

When writing out an email address or website URL, use all lowercase.

hello@palmetto.com
palmetto.com

Email addresses and #hashtags with multiple words can use CamelCase capitalization to help with legibility.

CustomerCare@palmetto.com
#PalmettoCustomersRock

The use of ALL CAPS is reserved for acronyms. To emphasize content, use bold font weights.

Capitalize the first letter of department names or titles (example: Sales Member or Customer Care).

Don't capitalize Random Words in the middle of sentences.

The following words should never be capitalized in a sentence. For more, see the Word List.

website
internet
online
email

Always capitalize:
Days, months, holidays, time periods, events (not seasons)
Cities, countries, nationalities, languages

### Contractions

They‚Äôre great! Contractions give your writing an informal, friendly tone so use them when needed. Overuse of contractions can make your writing sound choppy. It‚Äôs helpful to read each sentence out loud and write both words when it aids the flow of content.

### Emoji

Emojis are a fun way to add humor and visual interest to your writing, but use them infrequently and deliberately. When in doubt, leave it out. üôà

### Numbers

Spell out a number when it begins a sentence. Spell out any whole number between zero and ten unless used to indicate age, depth, height, length, width, or distance. Otherwise, use the numeral. This includes ordinals.

Ten new employees started on Monday, and 12 start next week.
I ate three donuts at Coffee Hour.
Meg won 1st place in last year‚Äôs Walktober contest.
We hosted a group of 8th graders who are learning to code.
She is 5 years old, 4 feet tall, and walked 8 miles to school.

Where numbers are linked to a unit of measurement (example: 6 kWh), use the numeral even if the number falls between zero and ten.

When using an expression typically written in spelled-out numbers, leave them that way.

A friendly welcome email can help you make a great first impression.
That is a third-party integration.
Save money with the all-in-one energy management platform that grows with you.
After you send your newsletter, Chris will give you a high-five.

Numbers over 3 digits get commas:

999
1,000
150,000

Write out big numbers in full, but you can abbreviate them if there are space restraints, as in a tweet or a chart: 1k, 150k, 5m.

### Dates

Generally, spell out the day of the week and the month. Abbreviate only if space is an issue.

Saturday, January 24, 1989
Sat., Jan. 24, 1989
Jan. 24, 1989

### Decimals and Fractions

Use fractions where they make the number easier to understand visually. You can also spell out the fraction or default to percentages if that aligns with the overall tone of what you‚Äôre writing.

Yes: 2/3
Sometimes: two-thirds
Save 50% on your monthly utility bill

Use decimal points for compound fractions , ex: 1.37 or 47.2. In most cases it isn‚Äôt necessary to use more than two decimal places.

### Percentages

Use the % symbol instead of spelling out "percent‚Äù.

### Ranges and Spans

Use a hyphen (-) to indicate a range or span of numbers. There should be no space on either side of the hyphen.

It takes 20-30 days.

If using from or between to introduce a range, do not use a hyphen.
This type of solar panel was produced between 1998 and 2008.

### Money

When writing about US currency, use the dollar sign before the amount. Include a decimal and number of cents if more than 0.

$20
$19.99

For large, round values, it‚Äôs ok to shorten and abbreviate with a symbol.

$5K
$1.2M

### Telephone Numbers

Use parentheses around the area code, and dashes (without spaces) between numbers. Use a country code if your reader is in another country.

(555) 867-5309
+1 (404) 123-4567

### Temperature

Use the degree symbol and the capital F abbreviation (with no space between) for Fahrenheit. Temperatures should always use Fahrenheit, not Celsius, and be written in numerals. Do not use ‚Äúdegree‚Äù or degree symbol with kelvin.

98¬∞F
3K or 3 kelvin

Time
Use numerals with am or pm: lower case, no periods, no space in between. It is ok to write out noon and midnight.

7:00am
7:30pm
3pm

Avoid the redundant: 10am this morning

Use a hyphen between times to indicate a time period. Add a space on either side of the hyphen when joining entities that are not the same. When entities are the same, you can omit both am or pm on start time and the spaces surrounding the hyphen.
7:00am - 10:30pm
8am - 9pm
2-4pm
7:45 - 9:00am

### Time Zones

Specify time zones when writing about an event or something else people would need to schedule. Since Palmetto‚Äôs home is in Charleston, SC, we default to Eastern Time.

7:30pm Eastern

Note time zones within the continental United States as follows:

Eastern Time: Eastern
Central Time: Central
Mountain Time: Mountain
Pacific Time: Pacific

When referring to international time zones, spell them out: Nepal Standard Time, Australian Eastern Time. If a time zone does not have a set name, use its Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) offset.

### Years and Time Periods

Abbreviate decades when referring to those within the past 100 years. Do not add an apostrophe before the s.

the ‚Äò00s
the ‚Äò90s

When referring to decades more than 100 years ago, be more specific:

the 1900s
the 1890s

### Unit of Measurement

When writing out a unit of measurement, add a space between the numeral and the unit. In most cases, you can omit the space when using a number plus a unit of measurement in a table.

6 kWh
1,800 Watts

### Punctuation

#### Apostrophes

The apostrophe‚Äôs most common use is making a word possessive but there are variations on how and when it is used.

Add apostrophe s to singular and plural nouns not ending in s:
The donut thief ate Sam‚Äôs donut.
The donut thief ate the women‚Äôs donuts.

Just add an apostrophe to singular and plural nouns ending in s. If it‚Äôs a name that ends in s, it‚Äôs ok to use an apostrophe s.
The donut thief ate Chris‚Äôs donut.
The donut thief ate the girls‚Äô donuts.

For compound possessive or joint possessive phrases, use the rules above for the word closest to the object possessed.
The donut thief ate the attorney general‚Äôs donut.
The donut thief ate the world presidents‚Äô donuts.
The donut thief ate Lori and Jared‚Äôs donuts.

Do not add an apostrophe when using possessive pronouns: its, hers, whose, ours, yours, theirs.
Do not add an apostrophe when plurals are not possessive: All homeowners want to add solar.
Do not add an apostrophe to form plurals.
The 2020s are going to be full of donuts.
He received all As.
I earned four PhDs before joining the company.

Apostrophes can also be used to denote that you‚Äôve dropped select letters or numbers usually for brevity, humor, or emphasis. This is fine in the ‚Äò20s, but do it sparingly. V‚Äôry sparingly.

#### Colons

Use a colon (rather than an ellipsis, em dash, or comma) to offset a list.

Erin ordered 3 kinds of donuts: glazed, chocolate, and pumpkin.

You can also use a colon to join 2 related phrases. If a complete sentence follows the colon, capitalize the 1st word.

I was faced with a dilemma: I wanted a donut, but I‚Äôd just eaten a bagel.
You were right: The grass is greener in North Carolina.

#### Commas

When writing a list, use the serial comma (also known as the Oxford comma).

Yes: David admires his parents, Oprah, and Justin Timberlake.
No: David admires his parents, Oprah and Justin Timberlake.

Use commas to enclose parenthetical expressions and before a conjunction introducing an independent clause.
My solar energy system, installed in 2014, is producing more power today than it was five years ago.
You may prefer fossil fuels, but solar energy is the cleanest energy source available.

Do not use a comma to join independent clauses. Instead, use a period, a semicolon, or a colon.

When all else fails, use common sense. If you‚Äôre unsure, read the sentence out loud. Where you find yourself taking a breath, use a comma.

#### Dashes and Hyphens

Use a hyphen (-) without spaces on either side to link words into a single phrase, or to indicate a span or range.

first-time user
Monday-Friday

Use an em dash (‚Äî) without spaces on either side to offset an aside. Always use a true em dash, not hyphens (- or --).

Palmetto Protect‚Äîjust one of our new products for homeowners‚Äîcan help protect your solar power system.
Austin thought Brad was the donut thief, but he was wrong‚Äîit was Lain.

#### Ellipses

Ellipses (...) can be used to indicate a pause in speech, or that you‚Äôre trailing off before the end of a thought. Use them sparingly. Don‚Äôt use them for emphasis or drama, and don‚Äôt use them in titles or headers. Do not add space between the periods in an ellipses
( ... = correct / . . . = incorrect).

‚ÄúWhere did all those donuts go?‚Äù Christy asked. Lain said, ‚ÄúI don't know...‚Äù

Ellipses can be used to indicate a pause within a quote. When using in this way, add a space on both sides of the ellipses, but no spaces between the periods.

"You know, I just think ... I just think that the sun is going to power this whole planet one day."

Ellipses, in brackets, can be used to show that you're omitting words in a quote. If the omission falls at the end of a complete sentence, include the ending punctuation followed by a space and the ellipses.

‚ÄúWhen in the Course of human events it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another and to assume among the powers of the earth, [...] a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.‚Äù

In short:
... = Pause or trailing off thought
[...] = Omission

#### Periods

Periods go inside quotation marks. They go outside parentheses when the parenthetical is part of a larger sentence, and inside parentheses when the parenthetical stands alone.

Christy said, ‚ÄúI ate a donut.‚Äù
I ate a donut (and I ate a bagel, too).
I ate a donut and a bagel. (The donut was Sam‚Äôs.)

Leave a single space between sentences.

At times, it is ok to punctuate a word or phrase as a sentence to create emphasis. Use this technique sparingly. Very sparingly.

#### Question Marks

Question marks go inside quotation marks if they‚Äôre part of the quote. Like periods, they go outside parentheses when the parenthetical is part of a larger sentence, and inside parentheses when the parenthetical stands alone.

#### Exclamation Points

Use exclamation points sparingly! And never use more than one at a time. They‚Äôre like high-fives: A well-timed one is great, but too many can be annoying (and a misplaced exclamation point can feel like a swing and a miss).

Exclamation points go inside quotation marks. Like periods and question marks, they go outside parentheses when the parenthetical is part of a larger sentence, and inside parentheses when the parenthetical stands alone.

Never use exclamation points in failure messages, alerts, or buttons. When in doubt, avoid!

#### Quotation Marks

Use quotes to refer to words and letters, titles of short works (like articles and poems), and direct quotations.

Periods and commas go within quotation marks. Question marks within quotes follow logic‚Äîif the question mark is part of the quotation, it goes within. If you‚Äôre asking a question that ends with a quote, it goes outside the quote.

Use single quotation marks for quotes within quotes. Capitalize the first letter of a quote only if the quote is a complete sentence (or if it follows a colon).

Who was it that said, ‚ÄúA fool and his donut are easily parted‚Äù?
Brad said, ‚ÄúA wise man once told me, ‚ÄòA fool and his donut are easily parted.‚Äô‚Äù

#### Semicolons

Avoid semicolons if possible. They usually support long, complicated sentences that could easily be simplified. Try an em dash (‚Äî) instead, or simply start a new sentence.

#### Ampersands

Don't use ampersands unless one is part of a company or brand name.

Ben and Dan
Ben & Jerry‚Äôs

#### Slash

Slashes are sometimes useful in pairing terms (and/or, pass/fail) but can give writing a terse, choppy quality so should be used sparingly. When using a slash, do not add space on either side.

#### Parenthesis

Parenthesis can be used to contain incidental information such as examples or background details. Punctuation goes inside the parentheses only when the parenthetical expression can stand alone.

### People, Places, and Things

#### File Extensions

When referring generally to a file extension type, use all uppercase without a period. Add a lowercase s to make plural.

GIF
PDF
HTML
JPGs

When referring to a specific file, the filename should be lowercase. CamelCase should be used only if the file name contains an acronym.

MCBenefits.pdf
ben-twitter-profile.jpg
ilovedonuts.html

#### Pronouns

If your subject‚Äôs gender is unknown or irrelevant, use ‚Äúthey,‚Äù ‚Äúthem,‚Äù and ‚Äútheir‚Äù as a singular pronoun. Use ‚Äúhe/him/his‚Äù and ‚Äúshe/her/her‚Äù pronouns as appropriate. Don‚Äôt use ‚Äúone‚Äù as a pronoun.

When using possessive pronouns, follow the rules listed under apostrophes. Always make sure that possessive pronoun calls for a contraction. Look out for:

its - possessive / it‚Äôs - contraction of it is
your - possessive / you‚Äôre - contraction of you are
their - possessive / they‚Äôre - contraction of they are

#### Quotations and Tense

When quoting someone in a blog post or other publication, use the present tense.

‚ÄúUsing Palmetto has helped our business grow,‚Äù says Jamie Smith.

#### Names and Titles

The first time you mention a person in writing, refer to them by their first and last names. On all other mentions, refer to them by their first name.

Capitalize the names of departments and teams (including the word "Team" or "Department").

Marketing Team
Customer Experience Team
Support Department

Capitalize individual job titles when referencing a specific role. Don't capitalize when referring to the role in general terms.

Our new Marketing Manager starts today.
All the managers ate donuts.

Don't refer to someone as a ‚Äúninja,‚Äù ‚Äúrockstar,‚Äù or ‚Äúwizard‚Äù unless they literally are one.

#### States, Cities, and Countries

Spell out all city and state names. If using a city and state name together, you can abbreviate the state name if the city is well-known. Don‚Äôt abbreviate city names.

Per AP Style, all cities should be accompanied by their state, with the exception of: Atlanta, Baltimore, Boston, Chicago, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Dallas, Denver, Detroit, Honolulu, Houston, Indianapolis, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Miami, Milwaukee, Minneapolis, New Orleans, New York, Oklahoma City, Philadelphia, Phoenix, Pittsburgh, St. Louis, Salt Lake City, San Antonio, San Diego, San Francisco, Seattle, Washington.

On first mention, write out United States. On subsequent mentions, US is fine. The same rule applies to any other country or federation with a common abbreviation (European Union, EU; United Kingdom, UK).

#### URLs and Websites

Capitalize the names of websites and web publications. Don‚Äôt italicize.

Avoid spelling out URLs, but when you need to, leave off the http://www.

#### Writing About Palmetto

Our company's legal entity name is "Palmetto Solar, LLC". Our trade name is "Palmetto". Use "Palmetto Solar, LLC" only when writing legal documents or contracts. Otherwise, use "Palmetto".

Refer to Palmetto as ‚Äúwe‚Äù not ‚Äúit‚Äù.

Capitalize branded terms, like Palmetto Protect or the Palmetto App.

Don‚Äôt capitalize descriptive product or feature names, like email or landing pages.

templates
Palmetto‚Äôs mobile app
Essentials plan

#### Writing About Other Companies

Honor companies‚Äô own names for themselves and their products. When in doubt, go by what‚Äôs used on their official website.

iPad
YouTube
Yahoo!

Refer to a company or product as ‚Äúit‚Äù (not ‚Äúthey‚Äù).

#### Slang, Jargon, and Figures of Speech

Write in plain English. If you need to use a technical term, briefly define it so everyone can understand.

Palmetto's Operations Team is constantly scaling our servers to make sure our users have a great experience with our products. One way we do this is with shards, or partitions, that help us better horizontally scale our database infrastructure.

Similes, idioms, and figures of speech should be used cautiously as they can muddle the meaning of your content. In some cases, it can be fun to play on well-known, well-understood figures of speech but, before going willy-nilly, ask yourself:

Might it be confusing for anyone who is not a native English speaker?

Avoid internet slang and acronyms: brb, asap, cool af, afaik, etc. Even if placing FAQs, it is preferred to spell out Frequently Asked Questions when space allows.

#### Text Formatting

Use italics to indicate the title of a long work (like a book, movie, or album) or to emphasize a word.

Dunston Checks In
Brandon really loves Dunston Checks In.

Use apostrophes when referencing button and navigation labels in step-by-step instructions:

When you're all done, click ‚ÄòSend‚Äô.

Don‚Äôt use underline formatting, and don‚Äôt use any combination of italic, bold, caps, and underline.

Left-align text, never center or right-aligned.

Leave one space between sentences, never 2.

#### Write Positively

Use positive language rather than negative language. One way to detect negative language is to look for words like ‚Äúcan‚Äôt‚Äù, ‚Äúdon‚Äôt‚Äù, etc.

Yes: To get a donut, stand in line.
No: You can‚Äôt get a donut if you don‚Äôt stand in line.
