# Voice and Tone

<div className="mw-4xl">

One way we write empowering content is by being aware of our voice and our tone. This section explains the difference between voice and tone, and lays out the elements of each as they apply to Palmetto.

What’s the difference between voice and tone? Think of it this way: You have the same voice all the time, but your tone changes. You might use one tone when you're out to dinner with your closest friends, and a different tone when you're in a meeting with your boss.

Your tone also changes depending on the emotional state of the person you’re addressing. You wouldn’t want to use the same tone of voice with someone who’s scared or upset as you would with someone who’s laughing.

The same is true for Palmetto. Our voice doesn’t change much from day to day, but our tone changes all the time.

## Voice

We want to educate people without patronizing or confusing them.
We prefer the subtle over the noisy.
We don't take ourselves too seriously.

Whether people know exactly what they’re looking for or don’t know the first thing about energy, every word they read should inform and clarify. We impart our expertise with empathy, encouragement, comradery, and wit.

## Tone

Palmetto’s tone is friendly, helpful, and informal. When you’re writing, consider the reader’s state of mind. Are they relieved to be getting their system installed? Are they confused and seeking our help on Twitter? Once you have an idea of their emotional state, you can adjust your tone accordingly.

Palmetto has a sense of humor, so feel free to be funny when appropriate. Never go out of your way to make a joke—forced humor can be worse than none at all. If you’re unsure, keep a straight face and remember: It’s more important to be clear than entertaining.
