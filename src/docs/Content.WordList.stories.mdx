#### Palmetto Capitalization

When writing about Palmetto products/platform, it’s important to be consistent with capitalization so that we can reinforce the uniqueness of these offerings.

- "Ambassador" should be capitalized when talking about our Ambassador Program or Ambassadors. Also, “Program” must be written with a capital P.
  - Ambassador
  - Ambassador Program
  - Palmetto Ambassador Program
  - the Palmetto Ambassador Program
- “Mapdwell” has no capital letters other than the ‘M’.
- “Palmetto App” should use the capital A to identify it as a specific product. Also, it should always be referred to as “Palmetto App” or “the Palmetto - App”, not App.
