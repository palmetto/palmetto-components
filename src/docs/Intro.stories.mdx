# Palmetto Design System

Welcome to the Palmetto Design System, whose purpose is to help us deliver high quality Palmetto branded applications, faster and better. It consists of the following:

- [Palmetto Components](https://github.com/palmetto/palmetto-components) - an open source, react, component library for Palmetto applications and websites.
- [Palmetto Design Tokens](https://github.com/palmetto/palmetto-design-tokens) - A central location to store shared attributes of the Palmetto Design System. These include things like color, fonts, spacing, and more.
- [Palmetto Design Tokens Figma](https://www.figma.com/design/abGRptpr7iPaMsXdEPVm6W/Design-Tokens?node-id=0-1&t=lrjGWsHEtCpB42ZZ-1) - The Palmetto Design Tokens package reads this figma file to build the dictionary of design tokens.
- [Palmetto Design System Figma](https://www.figma.com/design/k1kOsplTGXvSSMQQCzhCND/Palmetto-Design-System?node-id=1035-13864&t=8eOhpstn9zXi8xyj-1) - Corresponding Figma components of the Palmetto Components.
